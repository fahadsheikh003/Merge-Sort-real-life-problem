# Merge-Sort-real-life-problem
A race is organized among N horses of a kingdom. Every horse has a velocity (in m/sec) that is denoted by an array Velocity [ ] where Velocity[i] represents the velocity of the ith horse. All the horses are standing at different starting positions. The starting points are in the same order as the order of horses in the velocity array. A horse who is standing at ith position is considered to be ahead of the horse who is standing at position j if and only if i>j. The finish line of the race is 1000000 meters ahead. Count the number of overtakes that will occur during the race. Note: Implement it by using merge sort Input: 3 2 1 4 Output:  3
